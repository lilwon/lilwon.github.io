This project is one of my favorites in UCI since me and my friend built a website
from scratch.

I took this project course in Spring 2021. An old website of the class can be found 
[here](https://grape.ics.uci.edu/wiki/public/wiki/cs122b-2019-winter). 
There weren't any changes to the requirements to any of the projects.

No code/Github repo is listed because this project course is offered almost every
quarter in UCI and always have the same requirements. 

## Background

The course project is building a fictitious e-commerce website called *Fabflix*. 
On the website, you can find and purhcase movies. 

You have to build everything from scratch. 

## Task 1 - Setting up the Website 

Task 1 was a simple start to the project. We had to create DDL statements to
start the foundation for our database. The requirements were already given to us,
we just had to make them work when we import the data. 

My friend and I used AWS to host our web server (it's required for the project). 
We used MySQL as our database and Apache Tomcat as our application server. 

Since the course was to scale and improve our website, we had to choose an 
architecture design. We ended up choosing a REST API since it was the easiest to
maintain and we didn't have to change anything for future tasks.  

After we got our database running, we had to make the front end of the 
website. For Task 1, we only had to create 3 pages that had a "jump" functionality
(the pages can be redirect to each other).

For every task, we had to record a demo of our site functionality.
So here's Task 1's video.

## Task 2 - Development of the Website

Task 2 was the most strenuous task since we were only given two weeks to develop
a well built website. From knowing nothing to building a full-fledge website
was difficult.. but we managed to do it and we learned a lot. 

We were required to build a login page, a search page, and a shopping cart.

Here's a demo of Task 2.
