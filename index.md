Hi! I am **Lillian Won**.

I was born and raised in Northern California. I received my Bachelor of Computer Science from UC Irvine. 
I am a data integration developer for a company in Folsom.

I love working with Big Data and NoSQL databases. 
On the side, I study algorithms and other software development stacks (mostly backend development since that's where the data is!). 
In general, I really like learning new things!

This website is used to showcase my projects and what I'm learning. 

If you would like to reach out to me, please contact me through LinkedIn.
