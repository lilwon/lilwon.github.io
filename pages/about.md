# **About Me**

Hi! I am **{{ site.author.name }}**.

I was born and raised in Sacramento County, CA. I am currently living in
Irvine, CA to finish my undergraduate program. This website is used to showcase
some projects that I've created and to discuss my hobbies. Some of my hobbies 
include coding, gaming, papercrafting, cooking, and more! 

Feel free to learn more about me through my blog posts.
