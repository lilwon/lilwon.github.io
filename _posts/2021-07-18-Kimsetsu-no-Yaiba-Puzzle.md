## TLDR

Finished a Demon Slayer (鬼滅の刃) puzzle.

---

It's been a few years since I did my last jigsaw puzzle. The last one I did was
a Kingdom Hearts 3 puzzle in the summer of 2019.

The puzzle that I did this time was a [Demon Slayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Slayer:_Kimetsu_no_Yaiba_the_Movie:_Mugen_Train) puzzle. 

## Mugen Train Movie
If you're a fan of Kimetsu no Yaiba and kept up with the anime, it's a must watch
movie since it's part of the major storyline.

I won't go into any details of the movie, but would like to say that it made me
cry. The movie was on par to the anime series and ufotable did an amazing job
being faithful to the manga. 

## The Puzzle
I was bored one day and was looking through Amazon JP to see if they had 
any puzzles available. I always used HLJ to buy all my Japanese jigsaw puzzles,
but their good puzzles are always sold out or backordered. 

I always wanted to do a Kimetsu no Yaiba puzzle, but the puzzles that were 
available were either 500 pieces or were 1000 pieces and did not look good. 
So when I found this puzzle on Amazon JP, I wanted to buy it asap. I showed 
my boyfriend and he offered to buy it for me. :)
