## TLDR

Finished a Demon Slayer (鬼滅の刃) puzzle.

---

It's been a few years since I did my last jigsaw puzzle. The last one I did was
a Kingdom Hearts 3 puzzle in Summer 2019.

This time, I completed a [Demon Slayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Slayer:_Kimetsu_no_Yaiba_the_Movie:_Mugen_Train) puzzle. 

## Mugen Train Movie
If you're a fan of Kimetsu no Yaiba and kept up with the anime, it's a must-watch
movie since it's part of the major storyline.

I won't go into any details of the movie, but it did make me cry. 
The movie was on par with the anime series, and Ufotable did an amazing job
being faithful to the manga. 

## Puzzle Building
I was bored one day and was looking through Amazon JP to see if they had 
any puzzles available. I always use [HLJ](https://www.hlj.com/) to buy all my Japanese jigsaw puzzles,
but their best puzzles are always sold out or backordered.

I always wanted to do a Kimetsu no Yaiba puzzle, but the puzzles that were 
available were either 500 pieces or 1000 pieces and didn't look good. 
So when I found this puzzle on Amazon JP, I wanted to buy it asap. I showed 
my boyfriend and he bought it for me. :) It took less than two weeks for the 
puzzle to arrive, which is about the same as HLJ. 

My boyfriend and I did not start the puzzle until July 5. It took about 5 
days to finish it (only 2-3 hours each day because we both have work).

I forgot to take progression photos until we were almost done...
The first image to the left is day one. The middle image is day four. And the
right image is the completed puzzle. 

The puzzle was very annoying because of the dark background. We had to use
our phones' flashlights to differentiate the colors of the dark pieces. It 
got to the point where we started to try to fit all the pieces to wherever
it may work. Ensky puzzles are great since every piece/connection is unique. 

I just bought a frame for the puzzle, so all we need to do is glue it  
and find a spot for it in my room... along with the other puzzles.
