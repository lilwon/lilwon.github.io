## TLDR
Fixed up my first mechanical keyboard.

## Background
The Ducky One was my first mechanical keyboard and was my gateway into the hobby.
I bought the Ducky One with Brown Cherry switches back in 2016. I was too scared 
to build my own keyboard at the time, and I heard so many great things about the Ducky.
So I ended up buying a prebuilt keyboard. 

After using the keyboard for about for about eight years, it was time to open it up
and do some deep cleaning and adjustments.

How far keyboards have come!! Back in 2016, I was so scared to make my own keyboard
because I had to solder and why I chose to buy a pre-built one. 
I ended up teaching myself how to solder since I needed to use it for one of my classes at UCI,
and it's actually really easy. 

The Ducky One had the switches soldered into the PCB, so I had to figure out how to unsolder it.
And man, desoldering is very, very time consuming. At first, I tried using a solder wick with flux
and I couldn't get it to work at all. Luckily my kit came with a desoldering pump and that worked
a lot better. The most annoying part of using the desolder pump was that it's messy and I had to 
clean very frequently.
