excerpt: Need more space? Build a small form factor PC.
---

## TLDR

Moved everything from a Fractal Design Meshify C case (36.5L) to a Cooler Master NR200 (18.25L). 

## Background 

When I first built my PC in summer 2020, I wasn't sure about the size or how big I wanted it.
After a year, I finally decided it was time to switch to a smaller form factor. 
I've been looking at [/r/battlestations/](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/) way too
much on my free time. 


## Out With the Old

The list for my old build can be found [here](https://lillianwon.com/post/Before-the-2020-2021-School-Year-Began/#building-my-own-tower-pc).
On the right is what my build looks like with the Meshify C case. 
It was tough hauling it everywhere (to Irvine and back...) 
I had to drag it to the garage to clean out the dust multiple times a year. 
The Meshify C is a great case, but a PC just doesn't need to take that much space.

## In With the New

I was really hoping that the B550i mobo would go back to its old price ($189), 
but it didn't budge for the past 2 months. I got the NR200 case on Amazon and got the $10
rebate a few days ago. I'm hoping to get another rebate ($20) from the PSU.
I added the speakers to the list because they were also on sale (from Costco) and they've been
working really well so far.   

And here's the build: 
![sffpc](https://u.cubeupload.com/lilwon/2021102302.jpg)

What's not pictured are the extra case fans.
I put two arctic fans on the top as an exhaust. I have 3 more arctic fans 
and I'll probably add it below the GPU. The cable management isn't that great right now.
I'll add/get custom cables for that, but it doesn't looking too bad
the way it is right now.   

The new build doesn't generate that much heat compared to my old build. I've been
playing FFXIV and it plays the same. The only thing that I need to upgrade 
is my desk space...
