## TLDR 

Always use moisturizer, sunscreen, and SHARK SAUCE.

I've been meaning to write reviews for all the Asian beauty products that I purchased
along the years. For most of my life I never really cared about my skin. Every product
that I used before I started purchasing Asian products was whatever my mom gave me. I
was always told to not touch my face and to not pop the pimples, but I never listened.
I got a lot of acne scars during high school and they never went away. 

So for the past five years or so after reading forums and buying various products, I 
finally found a few that helped clear my face.

## Skin-type
My skin type varies when I'm in a different environment (Northern California 
and Southern California). I believe it's because of the moisture and mainly the water
that I use to wash my face. <br> 

NorCal - Dry <br>
I'm not sure why my face becomes really dry in Sacramento. At home I am using soft water
for everything. Maybe it's also the humidity that's affecting my skin as well.  

SoCal - Normal  <br>
My face **LOVES** Irvine weather. I'm not sure if the water is hard or soft, but my
face never dries up after I finish washing it.

**I have no affiliations to any of the products that are linked/listed** 

1. [Banila Co Clean it Zero Cleansing Balm](https://banilausa.com/collections/clean-it-zero/products/clean-it-zero-cleansing-balm-original)<br>
   I've bought this product from an authentic Korean website in 2017. I **LOVED** the 
   2017 edition of the product (I don't know if the USA edition is a different formula or
   if they changed their formula since then).
   It had a great scent when I applied it to my face to wash off sunscreen. It came with a 
   small scoop to apply to your face. One scoop was enough for me. I would buy this again, 
   but only from a Korean vendor. 

2. [Beauty of Joseon Dynasty Cream](https://www.beautyofjoseon.com/product-page/dynasty-cream)<br>
   This was one of the first Asian moisturizers that I've tried and it was **AMAZING**. I've 
   bought this item multiple times throughout the years of testing and I always came back to
   this. It smells great and hydrates my face for the entire day! 
   The only downside is that it's extremely pricely (~$25+) for a small bottle (50mL).
   It lasted me about 2-3 months before I had to get a new one. I bought this item
   from a Korean website in 2017 (~$9-10/bottle!!) but that doesn't include the shipping fees. 
   When I stopped buying from Korean vendors, I found that Amazon also sold it but for $29/bottle.
   Since this product was too expensive for a small amount, I didn't want to use it 
   anymore even though my skin loved it... 

3. [COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid](https://www.cosrx.com/cosrx-bha-blackhead-power-liquid-1.html)<br>
   I purchased this item in the beginning of 2017 on a Korean website,
   when I first started creating my own
   Asian beauty skin routine. I didn't notice anything when I used it and there was also
   a strong smell to it that I didn't like. I don't think it did anything to my skin after
   a few months of use. 

4. [COSRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid](https://www.cosrx.com/cosrx-aha-7-whitehead-power-liquid-1.html)<br>
   I purchased this at the same time of the BHA Blackhead Power Liquid. There was also a smell
   on this product too that I wasn't fond of. It's supposed to lessen my whiteheads, but
   I don't think it did anything either.  

5. [COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence](https://www.cosrx.com/cosrx-advanced-snail-96-mucin-power-essence-1.html) <br>
   I've bought this product multiple times (once from Korea, another from Amazon),
   hoping and believing that snail essence/mucus 
   would heal my skin from pimples and acne scars, but nope. I only used it as a second
   moisturizer to hydrate my skin. I have no idea if it made my skin any better, but 
   it kept my skin hydrated. There's no scent to this product which I really liked 
   because I dislike the other COSRX products that I bought. 

6. [Mizon Snail Recovery Gel](https://mizonworld.com/shop/mizon-snail-recovery-gel-cream/)<br>
   I bought this item in 2018 on Amazon because I wanted to try another snail product other
   than the COSRX one. Like the other snail product, I don't think it did anything 
   except hydrate my face similar to the COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin. I felt like 
   this product was more pricey since I was paying the same price but for a smaller
   amount (45mL).  Overall snails doesn't do anything to my skin besides keeping it
   adding another layer of hydration.

7. [Rohto Melano CC Vitamin C Essence](https://jp.rohto.com/melanocc/)<br>
   I purchased this item in the beginning of 2018 on Amazon. I wanted something to lighten
   my acne scars and this was a pretty decent alternative to the Korean Vitamin C Essences.
   I also wanted to try a Japanese product. 
   It was very liquidy and I think it did light up a few of my dark spots. There was a faint
   smell, but it didn't bother me too much. I don't think it improved my skin that much, 
   so I didn't purchase it again.
