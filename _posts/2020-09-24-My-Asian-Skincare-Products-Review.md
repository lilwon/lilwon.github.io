## TLDR 

Always use moisturizer, sunscreen, and SHARK SAUCE.

---

I've been meaning to write reviews for all the Asian beauty products that I purchased
along the years. For most of my life I never really cared about my skin. Every product
that I used before I started purchasing Asian products was whatever my mom gave me. I
was always told to not touch my face and to not pop the pimples, but I never listened.
I got a lot of acne scars during high school and they never went away. 

So for the past five years or so after reading forums and buying various products, I 
finally found a few that helped clear my face. I'm not going to give any numeric 
ratings for the products because everyone's rating system may mean something else
to others.

## Skin-type
My skin type varies when I'm in a different environment (Northern California 
and Southern California). I believe it's because of the moisture and mainly the water
that I use to wash my face. <br> 

NorCal - Dry <br>
I'm not sure why my face becomes really dry in Sacramento. At home I am using soft water
for everything. Maybe it's also the humidity that's affecting my skin as well.  

SoCal - Normal  <br>
My face **LOVES** Irvine weather. I'm not sure if the water is hard or soft, but my
face never dries up after I finish washing it.

**I have no affiliations to any of the products that are linked/listed** 

1. [Banila Co Clean it Zero Cleansing Balm](https://banilausa.com/collections/clean-it-zero/products/clean-it-zero-cleansing-balm-original)<br>
    I've bought this product from an authentic Korean website in 2017. I **LOVED** the 
    2017 edition of the product (I don't know if the USA edition is a different formula or
    if they changed their formula since then).
    It had a great scent when I applied it to my face to wash off sunscreen. It came with a 
    small scoop to apply to your face. One scoop was enough for me. I would buy this again, 
    but only from a Korean vendor. 

2. [Beauty of Joseon Dynasty Cream](https://www.beautyofjoseon.com/product-page/dynasty-cream)<br>
    This was one of the first Asian moisturizers that I've tried and it was **AMAZING**. I've 
    bought this item multiple times throughout the years of testing and I always came back to
    this. It smells great and hydrates my face for the entire day! 
    The only downside is that it's extremely pricely (~$25+) for a small bottle (50mL).
    It lasted me about 2-3 months before I had to get a new one. I bought this item
    from a Korean website in 2017 (~$9-10/bottle!!) but that doesn't include the shipping fees. 
    When I stopped buying from Korean vendors, I found that Amazon also sold it but for $29/bottle.
    Since this product was too expensive for a small amount, I didn't want to use it 
    anymore even though my skin loved it... 

3. [COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid](https://www.cosrx.com/cosrx-bha-blackhead-power-liquid-1.html)<br>
    I purchased this item in the beginning of 2017 on a Korean website,
    when I first started creating my own
    Asian beauty skin routine. I didn't notice anything when I used it and there was also
    a strong smell to it that I didn't like. I don't think it did anything to my skin after
    a few months of use. 

4. [COSRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid](https://www.cosrx.com/cosrx-aha-7-whitehead-power-liquid-1.html)<br>
    I purchased this at the same time of the BHA Blackhead Power Liquid. There was also a smell
    on this product too that I wasn't fond of. It's supposed to lessen my whiteheads, but
    I don't think it did anything either.  

5. [COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence](https://www.cosrx.com/cosrx-advanced-snail-96-mucin-power-essence-1.html) <br>
    I've bought this product multiple times (once from Korea, another from Amazon),
    hoping and believing that snail essence/mucus 
    would heal my skin from pimples and acne scars, but nope. I only used it as a second
    moisturizer to hydrate my skin. I have no idea if it made my skin any better, but 
    it kept my skin hydrated. There's no scent to this product which I really liked 
    because I dislike the other COSRX products that I bought. 

6. [Mizon Snail Recovery Gel](https://mizonworld.com/shop/mizon-snail-recovery-gel-cream/)<br>
    I bought this item in 2018 on Amazon because I wanted to try another snail product other
    than the COSRX one. Like the other snail product, I don't think it did anything 
    except hydrate my face similar to the COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin. I felt like 
    this product was more pricey since I was paying the same price but for a smaller
    amount (45mL).  Overall snails doesn't do anything to my skin besides keeping it
    adding another layer of hydration.

7. [Rohto Melano CC Vitamin C Essence](https://jp.rohto.com/melanocc/)<br>
    I purchased this item in the beginning of 2018 on Amazon. I wanted something to lighten
    my acne scars and this was a pretty decent alternative to the Korean Vitamin C Essences.
    I also wanted to try a Japanese product. 
    It was very liquidy and I think it did light up a few of my dark spots. There was a faint
    smell, but it didn't bother me too much. I don't think it improved my skin that much, 
    so I didn't purchase it again.

8. [Dermaesthetics Super Moisture Cream](https://dermaestheticsusa.com/products/super-moisture-cream-2)<br>
    A very pricey moisturizer that I am currently using. I get this item from my mom. It's
    a very heavy moisturizer. I believe that the moisturizers lasts for a few hours on my 
    face, but needs to be reapplied every so often. It has a decent scent, but the 
    coverage isn't very great. I usually use a large amount to cover my entire face. If
    I had to buy this product myself, I don't think I would use it.

9. [Biore UV Aqua Watery Essence SPF50++++](https://www.amazon.com/Biore-Aqua-Watery-Essence-SPF50/dp/B071H7P3T8)<br>
    This is my go-to sunscreen ever since I started my Asian beauty routine.
    I always buy this product in a pack of 3 on Amazon. I believe it was either 
    2016 or 2017 that Biore JP started to change the formula of this sunscreen.
    The change that was noticeable to me was that there was now a metallic scent in the
    sunscreen. It bothered me at first, but I continued to use it because it was still
    a great sunscreen that lasted all day on my skin.  

10. [Shiseido Anessa Perfect UV Sunscreen Milk](http://anessa.shiseido.co.jp/en/products/suncare/perfect_uv_sm/)<br>
    I recently bought this sunscreen (September 2020) on Amazon because I wanted to
    try something other than Biore. This sunscreen is very liquidy and has no scent. I really 
    enjoy using this product so far. It was about $28, so a lot pricier than the Biore 3 pack I 
    usually buy on Amazon. I would buy this again unless my wallet has a say in it...

11. [Holy Snails Shark Sauce](https://www.holysnails.com/products/shark-sauce?variant=20909831686)<br>
    **THIS IS MY FAVORITE PRODUCT.** Shark Sauce doesn't involve any sharks! Like I mentioned,
    I've been struggling to hide/fade away my dark spots and after using shark sauce for more than
    a year, I no longer have any acne spots. I've definitely noticed a dramatic change in my 
    skin brightening whenever I use this product. You can also make this yourself, but I'm no
    chemist so I'd rather just buy it from Holy Snails. I purchased the 30mL size and it has 
    lasted me almost a whole year. 

12. [Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask Berry Mix](https://us.laneige.com/products/lip-sleeping-mask)<br>
    Need your lips feeling soft and smooth? Then this is the product you're looking for! I apply
    this every morning and night like a lip balm every single day. 
    Maybe that's too much, but my lips **LOVE** it. 
    I purhcased this item in 2017 and am still using the same bottle now! It says it expires soon,
    but I don't think it matters much because I'm almost done using it all. I'll probably try
    the other scents/flavors when I run out, or another product since I've been using this
    for almost 3 years.

13. [Hado Labo Gokujyun Hyaluronic Lotion Premium](https://jp.rohto.com/hadalabo/promo/g-premium/)<br> 
    I also bought this recently this year because I ran out of my Hado Labo Gokujyun Hyaluronic 
    REGULAR verison. The premium version is much better for my face in a dry environment. It's
    a toner so it's the first thing that you apply after you wash your face. It's very 
    hydrating and does a better job than the regular version. I love Hado Labo because there's
    no scent at all and it does what it needs to (which is to not make my face dry!). 

14. [Stratia Liquid Gold](https://www.stratiaskin.com/products/liquid-gold)<br>
    I got this product in June 2019. I use it on and off because I can't stand the scent it 
    gives off. I was using it as a moisturizer, but it does not keep my face moisturzied for 
    a long time. I don't think I would buy this again because of the price and the smell.

## Overall

I've tried a few more products within the last few years, but I didn't have the bottle or the box,
so I forgot which items I bought. The item that was very effective for my face is Holy Snails
Shark Sauce. It cleared and brighten up my face so much since I've used it. My favorite 
moisturizer in this list would be the Joseon Dynasty Cream (if only it was cheaper!). And my 
favorite sunscreen is the Biore pre-2016 edition. It's so much cheaper than the Shiseido Anessa.

I hope you enjoyed reading my review of these items. I'll hope to do more soon!
