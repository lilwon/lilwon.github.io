## TLDR
Built an [*Initial D*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_D) inspired keyboard. 

## Getting the Keyboard 
I bought the keyboard back in July 2024 during the R2 drop. 
I didn't get it until December 2024 and finished building on 
April 2025. This is the most expensive keyboard that I've 
purchased so far. I am an *Initial D* fan and the keyboard is truly stunning. 

The keyboard weighs about 6-7 pounds and that's because the  
casings are made out of aluminum. It has RGB lights that resembles the
Trueno 86 rear tail lights.

## The Build

There are 3 mounting styles for the W70. I went with the Spring mount 
to make it feel like a car suspension.

I used AEBoard Staebies for the keyboard stabilizers and went with 
Gateron Oil Kings for the switches. 
I decided to use GMK Metropolis R2 keycaps with some novelties 
for this build. I think the bright contrast keycaps of the novelties 
fits the keyboard's aesthetics.

And that's the full build! The keyboard is mostly a showcase. 
It feels really good to type with though especially with the Oil King
switches. I swap back and forth between using this keyboard and 
the MKC75 at home.

It's such a beautiful (and expensive) keyboard that I love looking
at it instead of using it. 

Hopefully this teaches me a lesson to make me stop buying keyboards.
