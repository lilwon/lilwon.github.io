## TLDR
Stuff I did over the summer -- learn webdev, play games, watch anime/dramas,
etc in no particular order. 

___


After Spring 2020 finals were over, I didn't have any plans for the summer.
I kept telling myself to learn Python or something since my future classes
possibly require it for upcoming projects or something. But instead of learning 
Python, I dove into HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

I really enjoyed learning web-dev. I created everything from
scratch and learned a lot. It made me a lot happier knowing that I might
really want to be a front or back-end developer (or full-stack!). I'm really
grateful for resources like The Odin Project for being a great guide for
learning all the materials. I'm haven't finished a track yet, but I'm
getting there. Hopefully, I can do it during school as well, but with how
my upcoming courses are next quarter it's looking unlikely.  

#### Building my own Tower PC
I realized that my current laptop, an ASUS Q55LF, is about *7 years* old. 
I've used it for almost everything, like playing games, my projects,
etc. I couldn't even play any games like *Fortnite*, *League of Legends*,
*GTA5*, etc.

I've changed my Surface twice (Surface Book 3 in 2015, Surface Book 6 
in 2018) and that was my go-to device for taking notes and programming, but
I wanted something that was more powerful -- something that could handle games,
PhotoShop, many virtual machines. So it was either purhcase a gaming laptop or
building my own PC. I went with the latter.

I based my build off of [Logical Increment's](https://www.logicalincrements.com/) 
Superb build. Since COVID was happening, lots of PC parts were out of stock and
prices were up. Thankfully I found most of my items on sale through
/r/buildapcsales.

Below is my PC build. The parts were bought from Amazon, Newegg, and BestBuy.

I was able to get some things for free because they were gifted to me from
my friends for my birthday! The total MSRP of all items would be about 
**$1600**, so I was able to save about $400 or so. I created my own spreadsheet
to markdown the timeline of when I bought all of the items and built the PC.
I started looking at PC parts May 19 and purchased all my parts on June 14. 
The day I powered on the PC was July 11, 2020. 


The PC is definitely an upgrade from my 7 year old laptop. I can finally play
games without any lag and run virtual machines without any trouble!

#### Some games I played 
* [Persona 4 Golden](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1113000/Persona_4_Golden/)
* [Persona 5 Royal](https://atlus.com/p5r/lang/en/)
* [Kingdom Hearts III](https://www.kingdomhearts.com/3/us/home/)

Persona 4 Golden was a game I got from my friend as a "welcome gift" for my PC.
I was really grateful and I played the game for a bit. It's a really great 
port from the PSVita. I forgot how tiresome and repetitive the beginning 
of the game was, so I dropped it and went for Persona 5 Royal.

I'm probably going to do a review of Persona 5 Royal. The game is a really
good addition to Persona 5 (2016). The new character that was introduced is 
captivating and her storyline is great. It made me enjoy the series again.
Persona 5 Royal was the first game I platinumed on the PS4 too (it wasn't 
hard). 

Kingdom Hearts III... oh boy. I watched streamers play it when it first
released, so I wasn't that into playing since I already knew what was
going to happen. The game was fun, but it's definitely not like its
predecessor games. The game was pretty lackluster. I only finished the game
because I enjoy the series. 


If you're down here, thanks for reading my rambling blog post about what I 
did this summer.
