## TLDR
Moved my current build to a Fractal Terra. Reused the NR200 case to build another PC with modern parts.

## To Terra
Felt like downsizing from the NR200 (18L) to a Fractal Terra (10.4L). 
I ended up using my NR200 to build my cousin a PC. 

After using the Fractal Terra for a few months, the temperature runs about 3-5 degrees higher than the NR200.
