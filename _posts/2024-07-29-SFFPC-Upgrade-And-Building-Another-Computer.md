excerpt: Moving my PC parts from NR200 to a Fractal Terra

## TLDR
Moved my current build to a Fractal Terra. Reused the NR200 case to build another PC with modern parts.

## To Terra
Felt like downsizing from the NR200 (18L) to a Fractal Terra (10.4L). 
I ended up using my NR200 to build my cousin a PC. 

After using the Fractal Terra for a few months, the temperature runs about 3-5 degrees higher than the NR200. 

### Construction Underway

The first thing that was noticable is the size! NR200 is already a small
size, but the Fractal Terra is definitely a lot smaller in comparison. 

With a new-ish build comes some new-ish upgrades!

Upgraded the CPU from the 3600 to a used 5800. Just needed that extra
 CPU power. It draws in a lot more heat though. 

I really like the slim profile of the Noctua fan, and it fits perfectly
in the Fractal Terra. 

And the last upgrade is storage. Storage gets cheaper and cheaper each
year with all the advancements!

The Fractal Terra was the perfect size that fit all the components. 
Sure the temperatures run a bit higher, but that's the trade-off 
with smaller form factors. 

## New Build 

I was tasked with building my cousin a computer. I didn't want to go 
overkill with the budget especially when PC parts don't come with
any peripherals.

I gave my cousin some good discounts since I changed out some
of my stuff and gave it to him.

Most of the items were bought from Redditers and they were relatively new or brand new in box. Still got great discounts on there.

And it's alive!! I'm a bit sad that the amount that I spent 
3 years ago is now a bit outdated and slower compared to the amount 
and parts that I can get today. 

It's impractical to buy the latest and greatest PC parts...
unless you have a lot of disposable income. 
At least PC parts don't "expire". You can always resell your parts for 
some cash back.
