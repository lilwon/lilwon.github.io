## TLDR
Built my first computer. 

---

I realized that my current laptop, an ASUS Q55LF, is about *7 years* old. 
I've used it for almost everything, like playing games, my projects,
etc. I couldn't even play any games like *Fortnite*, *League of Legends*,
*GTA5*, etc without any lag.

I've changed my Surface twice (Surface Pro 3 in 2015, Surface Pro 6 
in 2018) and was my go-to device for taking notes and programming, but
I wanted something that was more powerful -- something that could handle games,
PhotoShop, many virtual machines. So it was either purchase a gaming laptop or
build my own PC... 

I based my build off of [Logical Increment's](https://www.logicalincrements.com/) 
Superb build. Since COVID was happening, lots of PC parts were out of stock and
prices were up. Thankfully I found most of my items on sale through
/r/buildapcsales.

I was able to get some things for free because they were gifted to me by
my friends for my birthday! The total MSRP of all items would be about 
**$1600**, so I was able to save about $400. I kept a spreadsheet
to markdown the timeline of when I bought all of the items and built the PC.
I started looking at PC parts May 19 and purchased all of the parts on June 14. 
The day I powered on the PC was July 11, 2020.
