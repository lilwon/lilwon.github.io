## TLDR
Stuff I did over the summer -- learn webdev, play games, watch anime/dramas,
etc in no particular order. 

___


After Spring 2020 finals were over, I didn't have any plans for the summer.
I kept telling myself to learn Python since my future classes
possibly require it for upcoming projects or something. But instead of learning 
Python, I dove into HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

I really enjoyed learning web-dev. I created everything from
scratch and learned a lot. It made me a lot happier knowing that I might
really want to be a front or back-end developer (or full-stack!). I'm really
grateful for resources like The Odin Project for being a great guide for
learning all the materials. I'm haven't finished a track yet, but I'm
getting there. Hopefully, I can do it during school as well, but with how
my upcoming courses are next school year it's looking unlikely.  

## Building my own Tower PC
I realized that my current laptop, an ASUS Q55LF, is about *7 years* old. 
I've used it for almost everything, like playing games, my projects,
etc. I couldn't even play any games like *Fortnite*, *League of Legends*,
*GTA5*, etc without any lag.

I've changed my Surface twice (Surface Book 3 in 2015, Surface Book 6 
in 2018) and was my go-to device for taking notes and programming, but
I wanted something that was more powerful -- something that could handle games,
PhotoShop, many virtual machines. So it was either purchase a gaming laptop or
build my own PC. I went with the latter.

I based my build off of [Logical Increment's](https://www.logicalincrements.com/) 
Superb build. Since COVID was happening, lots of PC parts were out of stock and
prices were up. Thankfully I found most of my items on sale through
/r/buildapcsales.

Below is my PC build. The parts were bought from Amazon, Newegg, and BestBuy.

I was able to get some things for free because they were gifted to me from
my friends for my birthday! The total MSRP of all items would be about 
**$1600**, so I was able to save about $400. I kept a spreadsheet
to markdown the timeline of when I bought all of the items and built the PC.
I started looking at PC parts May 19 and purchased all of the parts on June 14. 
The day I powered on the PC was July 11, 2020. 


The PC is definitely an upgrade from my 7 year old laptop. I can finally play
games without any lag and run virtual machines without any trouble!

## Some games I played 
* [Persona 4 Golden](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1113000/Persona_4_Golden/)
* [Persona 5 Royal](https://atlus.com/p5r/lang/en/)
* [Kingdom Hearts III](https://www.kingdomhearts.com/3/us/home/)

Persona 4 Golden was a game I got from my friend as a "welcome gift" for my PC.
I was really grateful and I played the game for a bit. It's a really great 
port from the PSVita....but I forgot how tiresome and repetitive the beginning 
of the game was, so I dropped it and went for Persona 5 Royal.

I'm probably going to do a review of Persona 5 Royal in another post! 
The game is a  
great addition to Persona 5 (2016). The new character that was introduced is 
captivating and her storyline is great. Atlus has done a really good job to
integrate the character into the game. It made me enjoy the series again.
Persona 5 Royal was the first game I platinumed on the PS4 too (it wasn't 
hard). 

Now, Kingdom Hearts III... I watched streamers play it when it first
released, so I wasn't rushing to finish the game since I already knew what was
going to happen. The gameplay was fun, but the storyline pretty lackluster. 
I only finished the game because I enjoyed the series. 


## Anime, Dramas, TV Shows, Movies
* Weathering With You [天気の子](https://myanimelist.net/anime/38826/tenki_no_ko)
* Mob Psycho 100 [モブサイコ100](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32182/Mob_Psycho_100)
* Mr. Hiiragi's Homeroom [3年A組](https://wiki.d-addicts.com/3_nen_A_gumi) <br>
... and more

Weathering With You was a pretty decent movie by Makoto Shinkai. It wasn't
as great as Your Name, but the animation was still on par. I mostly watch
Makoto Shinkai movies for the beautiful scenes anyways. 
Radwimps always does a great job with their movie soundtracks. 

Mob Psycho 100 -- I started watching this anime a few months ago, but I've
been putting it off because it was more of a fun watch and I didn't want to
binge it. It's a very light-hearted anime and I'll probably get to season 2
eventually...

Mr. Hiiragi's Homeroom was a really good drama that I decided to watch on
a whim. "LET'S THINK" was a really funny catch phrase that the teacher
said every episode. The drama was very sad, but heart-warming in the end.

I've watched a lot more shows than I've listed, but they are probably still 
currently airing, I haven't finished watching them, or I simply forgot
about them.

These are most of the memorable things that I've done this summer. Not much 
to do because of COVID and the wild fires (AQI was pretty bad),
making this summer pretty chill.

If you're down here, thanks for reading my rambling blog post.
