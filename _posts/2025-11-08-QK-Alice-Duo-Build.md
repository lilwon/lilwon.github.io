## TLDR
Built the [QK Alice Duo](https://www.qwertykeys.com/products/qk-alice-duo) keyboard. 


## Why Ergonomic?  
After using a standard keyboard for my entire life, I wanted to try something
different, and that's when the QK Alice Duo came in. It's a new keyboard
made by Qwertykeys and what caught my attention is that the keyboard is split in two.

I think the split design is much more ergonomic for my hands and arms.
With the keyboard split, my arms can be at a 90 degree 
angle while typing, although the mouse placement is a bit weird.  
An awesome feature would have been to include a trackpad on the QK Alice Duo.
Instead, the two dots at the end of the keyboard is a mode to change 
the RGB on the keyboard (although you can adjust it with Via app).

Having the keyboard split into two made me realize how horrible type touching 
with my right hand is. I realize that my right hand is mainly typing with the index 
finger and now that I'm using this keyboard, I'm training it to use my middle 
and ring finger more.

My WPM on a standard keyboard layout is about 140wpm, and it dropped to as low as 90wpm
with the Alice layout. I think I'll use the QK Alice Duo to practice typing, and switch
to a regular keyboard for work/main use.

## What The Box

The keyboard came inside this huge carrying case. For a split keyboard, why does it need such a large
case??

Both boards are about 2 pounds each. After building the W70 and using the spring mount, I wanted 
something a bit firmer, so I opted for the 1.6mm PCB board and the FR4 plate.

The keyboard came with its own stabilizers. I wanted to buy another set of stabilizers, but
most sets only come with 4 x 2U sized stabilizers. Because I want a larger backspace, I needed
an extra 2U stabilizer, so I opted to just use what Qwertykeys provided. 

I had a set of Baby Kangaroos tactile switches, lubed and ready to go so I threw them on the keyboard 
just to try. After using the keyboard for the past few days though, I'm most likely going to swap the 
switches out to a linear switch. I have the Akko Rosewood switches coming in, so I'm excited 
to try them.

I really like the color scheme of the bottom of the keyboard. The dark pink area is the adjustable tent 
to make the keyboard higher or lower to fit the curve of the hand.

After swapping the Yeeti keycaps to the W70, the Metropolis was free to be put on the Alice. 
I was panicking a little because none of my GMK sets had the Alice spacebars. 
Luckily, the KAM superuser spacebar set had something for me to use.

I will probably swap the Metropolis keycaps out in the future for another GMK set.

The Alice keyboard is very fun to use. I don't think I'll buy another Alice keyboard style
unless there's a special design or interesting feature with it. This keyboard is already
interesting enough with it being split into two boards.

## Update

### 2025-11-16
Swapped the Baby Kangaroo switches for Akko Rosewoods linear switches. Realized that I used
the Tribosys 3203 instead of the Krytox 205g0 for lubing the switch housing. 
The Akko Rosewood still feels fine though. 

The keyboard feels a lot better with linear switches and it requires a less actuation force.
It feels a lot less strenuous to type with the keyboard.
