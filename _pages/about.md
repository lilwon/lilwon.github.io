Hi! I'm **Lillian**.

I love working with Big Data and NoSQL databases. 
On the side, I enjoy studying algorithms and other software development stacks (mostly backend development since that's where the data is!). 

My hobbies are playing games mainly JRPGs, building keyboards, and tinkering with electronics. 

This website is used to showcase my projects and what I am working on.
