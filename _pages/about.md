Hi! I am **Lillian Won**.

I was born and raised in Northern California. I graduated UC Irvine with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Informatics. 
I am currently a data integration developer for a company in Folsom.

I love working with Big Data and NoSQL databases. 
On the side, I enjoy studying algorithms and other software development stacks (mostly backend development since that's where the data is!). 
My hobbies are playing games mainly JRPGs, building keyboards, and tinkering with electronics. 

This website is used to mainly showcase my projects and what I am working on. 

If you would like to reach out to me, please contact me through LinkedIn.
