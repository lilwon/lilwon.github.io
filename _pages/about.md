Hi! I am **Lillian Won**.

I was born and raised in Northern California. I received my Bachelor of Computer Science from UC Irvine. 
I am currently a data analyst for a company in Folsom.

I love working with Big Data and NoSQL databases. 
On the side, I enjoy studying algorithms and other software development stacks (mostly backend development since that's where the data is!). 
In general, I just really love to learn. (:

This website is used to mainly showcase my projects and what I'm learning. 

If you would like to reach out to me, please contact me through LinkedIn.
